# Arduino-based Flat Panel Driver
This project provides Arduino-based controller functionality to drive and 
interface to an LED panel intended to take flat-field images for 
astrophotography.  The implementation permits both manual (knob-settable)
driving intensity, as well as compatibility with the Alnitak Flat Panel
interface which is supported by a number of AP sequencing programs.

Included in this project are:
* Arduino source code
* Alnitak emulation source to test the Arduino implementation
* Electrical schematic against which this was developed
* Relevant Datasheets
